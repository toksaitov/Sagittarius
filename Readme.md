Sagittarius
===========

Sagittarius is a game to create a stable planetary systems around a supermassive
black hole. Place asteroid, comets, planets or stars around a black hole inside
a realistic gravitational simulator. Push astronomical body to put them into
stable orbits around each other and the central black hole. Earn points for
every object staying inside the universe. The bigger the body, the more points
you get. Be warned though! Gravity is a tricky thing to get right.

The game utilizes unique hardware features of iPhones and iPads to make it
possible to perform realistic gravitational simulation and visualization of
thousands of bodies in space right in the palm of your hand.

Compete with other players to build a bigger universe. See incredible
visualization to learn how massive astronomical bodies bend space. Record or
make pictures to share with friends as stars, planets and their moons are moving
around, smashing into million pieces with each other, or being consumed by the
dark heart of darkness.
