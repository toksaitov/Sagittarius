Sagittarius is a game to create a stable planetary systems around a supermassive
black hole. Place asteroid, comets, planets or stars around the most mysterious
thing in the universe inside a realistic gravitational simulator. Slingshot
astronomical bodies to put them into stable orbits around each other. Earn
points for every object staying inside the game field. The bigger the body, the
more points you get. Be warned though! Gravity is a tricky thing to get right.
Compete with other players to build a bigger system. See incredible
visualizations to learn how massive astronomical bodies bend space and time.
Record or make pictures to share with friends as stars, planets and moons
gracefully glide through space, smash into million pieces, or get consumed by
the giant heart of darkness.

The game utilizes unique hardware features of iPhones and iPads to make it
possible to perform realistic gravitational simulation and visualization of
thousands of bodies in space right in the palm of your hand.
